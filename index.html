        <h1 class="title">Who We Are</h1>
        <p>Our founders, accountant Jane and veterinarian Philip Simpson were very much cat people. Since they had been
            fostering cats throughout their careers, it seemed only natural at their retirement to move to Rosebush Farm,
            York, and to build our stunning premises. Now managed by Jane and Philip's neice, Claire Woods, the attitude
            that 'there's a saucer of milk for whoever wants it' has remained but we now work with the RSPCA, Cats' Protection,
            and WWF to ensure the safety of cats across the UK. Click <a href="">here</a> to find out more.
